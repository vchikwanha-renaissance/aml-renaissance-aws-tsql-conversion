	To convert this T-SQL code that uses XML functions to PostgreSQL 16 compatible code, we need to use PostgreSQL's XML functions and operators. Here's the equivalent PostgreSQL code:

<sql>
WITH xml_data AS (
    SELECT unnest(xpath('/roster/access/text()', var_PastRosterVisibility)) AS access,
           unnest(xpath('/roster/years/text()', var_PastRosterVisibility)) AS years,
           unnest(xpath('/roster/aaccess/text()', var_PastRosterVisibility)) AS aaccess
)
SELECT 
    COALESCE((xpath('/text()', access))[1]::text, 'Y')::char(1) AS var_AllowAccess,
    COALESCE((xpath('/text()', years))[1]::text, '2')::int AS var_PastYear,
    COALESCE((xpath('/text()', aaccess))[1]::text, 'N')::char(1) AS var_FutureYear
INTO var_AllowAccess, var_PastYear, var_FutureYear
FROM xml_data;
</sql>

<notes>
1. This code assumes that `var_PastRosterVisibility` is an XML type variable containing the roster visibility data.

2. We use a CTE (WITH clause) to extract the XML elements using xpath() function.

3. The unnest() function is used to handle potential multiple elements, although in this case we expect single elements.

4. We use COALESCE to provide default values similar to the original T-SQL code:
   - 'Y' for var_AllowAccess
   - 2 for var_PastYear (as per your earlier comment)
   - 'N' for var_FutureYear (assuming this is the default, adjust if needed)

5. The ::text cast is used to convert the XML node to text, and then we cast to the appropriate data type (char(1) or int).

6. The results are directly assigned to the variables var_AllowAccess, var_PastYear, and var_FutureYear using the INTO clause.

7. If these variables are not declared earlier in your function, you may need to add DECLARE statements for them before this code block.

This PostgreSQL code should provide equivalent functionality to the original T-SQL code, extracting values from the XML and assigning them to variables with appropriate default values.

<notes>
1. This code assumes that `var_SettingXML` is an XML type variable containing the setting data.

2. We use the `xpath()` function to extract values from the XML nodes. The `xpath()` function returns an array, so we use `[1]` to get the first (and presumably only) element.

3. We use `::text` to convert the XML node value to text, and then `::int` for integer fields.

4. The `unnest()` function is used with `xpath()` to iterate over all the `Type` nodes in the XML.

5. We're inserting directly into the `alltypevalues$appreportdefaultfilters` table, which should have been created earlier in the procedure with the appropriate columns.

6. This code handles the XML parsing and insertion in a single statement, which should be more efficient than row-by-row processing.

7. Error handling: If any of the XML nodes are missing or cannot be converted to the expected type, this will result in NULL values. You may want to add additional error handling or constraints to ensure data integrity.

8. Make sure that the `var_SettingXML` variable is properly populated with the XML data before this code runs.

This PostgreSQL code should provide equivalent functionality to the original T-SQL code, extracting values from the XML and inserting them into the `alltypevalues$appreportdefaultfilters` table.

	To convert the T-SQL EXECUTE statement to PostgreSQL 16 compatible code, we need to use the EXECUTE function with format() for dynamic SQL execution. Here's the equivalent PostgreSQL code:

<sql>
EXECUTE format('%s', var_RosterQuery);
</sql>

<notes>
1. In PostgreSQL, we use the EXECUTE function to run dynamic SQL.

2. The format() function is used to safely handle the dynamic SQL string. This helps prevent SQL injection attacks by properly escaping any variables used in the query.

3. var_RosterQuery should contain the full SQL query as a string. Make sure this variable is properly constructed earlier in the code with all necessary conditions and joins.

4. If var_RosterQuery contains any parameters that need to be inserted dynamically, you should use placeholders in the query string and pass the values separately. For example:

   EXECUTE format('%s', var_RosterQuery) USING param1, param2, ...;

5. Ensure that var_RosterQuery is properly constructed and all necessary tables (like #RosterStudents) are created before executing this statement.

6. If the original query was inserting data into a temporary table, make sure that the temporary table is created before this EXECUTE statement.

7. After execution, you may want to check if any rows were affected, depending on your requirements. You can do this by assigning the result to a variable:

   GET DIAGNOSTICS rows_affected = ROW_COUNT;

8. Error handling: Consider wrapping this execution in a BEGIN/EXCEPTION block to handle any potential errors that might occur during the execution of the dynamic SQL.

This PostgreSQL code should provide equivalent functionality to the original T-SQL EXECUTE statement, allowing for the execution of the dynamic SQL contained in var_RosterQuery.

5. Ensure that var_StudentGrpQuery is properly constructed and all necessary temporary tables (like #RosterStudents) are created before executing this statement.

6. After execution, you may want to check if any rows were affected, depending on your requirements. You can do this by assigning the result to a variable:

   GET DIAGNOSTICS rows_affected = ROW_COUNT;

7. Error handling: Consider wrapping this execution in a BEGIN/EXCEPTION block to handle any potential errors that might occur during the execution of the dynamic SQL.

8. Make sure that all temporary tables used in var_StudentGrpQuery (like #RosterStudents) are created as unlogged tables in PostgreSQL for better performance. For example:

   CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE IF NOT EXISTS t$rosterstudents (studentid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY);

9. The original code seems to be inserting data into #RosterStudents table. Ensure that this table is properly created and the INSERT operation is correctly handled in the PostgreSQL version.

10. If the var_StudentGrpQuery is complex or contains multiple statements, you might need to use PL/pgSQL's EXECUTE ... INTO STRICT syntax for handling result sets.

This PostgreSQL code should provide equivalent functionality to the original T-SQL EXECUTE statement, allowing for the execution of the dynamic SQL contained in var_StudentGrpQuery.

</sctComment>

	To convert this T-SQL code to PostgreSQL 16 compatible code, we need to handle XML parsing, string splitting, and insertion into a temporary table. Here's the equivalent PostgreSQL code:

<sql>
INSERT INTO t$l4wtemplatetable (templateid)
SELECT DISTINCT (unnest(string_to_array(templateid, ','))::INTEGER) AS newtemplateid
FROM (
    SELECT (xpath('/L4WMenuPGM/L4WSubject/Template/@ID', var_L4WMenuXML))[1]::TEXT AS templateid
) AS A
ORDER BY newtemplateid ASC;
</sql>

<notes>
1. XML Parsing:
   - PostgreSQL uses `xpath` function to extract values from XML. We use `xpath('/L4WMenuPGM/L4WSubject/Template/@ID', var_L4WMenuXML)` to get all ID attributes.
   - The `[1]::TEXT` is used to get the first element of the resulting array and cast it to TEXT.

2. String Splitting:
   - Instead of using a custom `fn_split` function, we use PostgreSQL's built-in `string_to_array` function to split the comma-separated string of IDs.

3. Unnesting and Casting:
   - The `unnest` function is used to expand the array of IDs into rows.
   - We cast each ID to INTEGER using `::INTEGER`.

4. Temporary Table:
   - We assume that `t$l4wtemplatetable` has already been created as a temporary table with a column named `templateid` of type INTEGER.

5. Distinct and Ordering:
   - We keep the `DISTINCT` and `ORDER BY` clauses to maintain the same behavior as the original query.

6. Variable Name:
   - We assume that `@L4WMenuXML` has been renamed to `var_L4WMenuXML` in the PostgreSQL version of the code.

This PostgreSQL code should provide equivalent functionality to the original T-SQL code, parsing the XML, extracting the IDs, splitting them if necessary, and inserting the distinct values into the temporary table in ascending order.

</sctComment>

	To convert the T-SQL EXECUTE statement for the ResultQuery to PostgreSQL 16 compatible code, we need to use the EXECUTE command with the format function. Here's the equivalent PostgreSQL code:

<sql>
EXECUTE format('%s', var_ResultQuery);
</sql>

<notes>
1. In PostgreSQL, we use the EXECUTE command to run dynamic SQL.

2. The var_ResultQuery variable contains the SQL statement as a string.

3. We use the format function to safely handle any potential SQL injection issues. The %s placeholder is used for the SQL string.

4. This approach assumes that var_ResultQuery is properly constructed earlier in the code with all necessary parameters and conditions.

5. Make sure that var_ResultQuery is properly sanitized and constructed to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

6. If var_ResultQuery contains multiple statements, you may need to use EXECUTE for each statement separately or combine them into a single transaction if appropriate.

7. If the query is expected to return results, you may need to use EXECUTE ... INTO or create a temporary table to store the results, depending on how they are used in the subsequent code.

8. Always ensure that the dynamic SQL in var_ResultQuery is constructed safely, especially if it includes user input or variables.

This PostgreSQL code should provide equivalent functionality to the original T-SQL EXECUTE statement, allowing for the execution of the dynamic SQL stored in the var_ResultQuery variable.

<notes>
1. We've changed the update syntax to use the PostgreSQL style, which puts the table to be updated first.

2. We've replaced the @AllTypeValues table variable with the temporary table alltypevalues$appreportdefaultfilters that was created earlier in the procedure.

3. We've used the par_UserRoleID and par_ReportType variables instead of @UserRoleID and @ReportType, as these are the parameter names used in the PostgreSQL function.

4. We've removed the LEFT JOIN and instead added a condition in the WHERE clause to match the report type. This avoids the self-referencing issue.

5. The UPDATE will only affect rows in alltypevalues$appreportdefaultfilters that match the ReportType and have a corresponding entry in the UserRole, UserRoleNetwork, and Network tables.

6. Make sure that the table and column names (UserRole, UserRoleNetwork, Network, NetworkID, Name) match your PostgreSQL schema exactly.

7. This query assumes that the alltypevalues$appreportdefaultfilters temporary table has already been created and populated earlier in the function.

8. If there's a possibility that no rows will be updated (which was possible with the LEFT JOIN in the original query), you might want to add additional error handling or logging.

This PostgreSQL code should provide equivalent functionality to the original T-SQL query while avoiding the issue with self-referenced tables without primary keys.

	To convert this T-SQL code to PostgreSQL 16 compatible code, we need to recreate the XML generation logic using PostgreSQL's XML functions. Here's the equivalent PostgreSQL code:

<sql>
SELECT var_Result := (
    SELECT xmlelement(name "Data",
        xmlagg(
            xmlelement(name "Type",
                xmlforest(
                    RT, RYID, RYN, RDSID, RDSN, SYID, SYN, COLID, COLN, ALID, ALN, 
                    TID, TN, CID, CN, NID, NN, SBID, SBN, AID, AN, URCID
                )
            )
        )
    )::text
)
FROM alltypevalues$appreportdefaultfilters;

-- Replace XML entities
UPDATE alltypevalues$appreportdefaultfilters
SET var_Result = replace(replace(var_Result, '&lt;', '<'), '&gt;', '>');
</sql>

<notes>
1. We use PostgreSQL's XML functions to generate the XML structure:
   - xmlelement creates XML elements
   - xmlagg aggregates multiple XML elements
   - xmlforest creates a forest of XML elements from the specified columns

2. We cast the result to text using ::text to match the original T-SQL output type.

3. The replace function is used to convert XML entities back to their original characters, mimicking the behavior of the original T-SQL code.

4. Instead of using a table variable (@AllTypeValues), we use the temporary table alltypevalues$appreportdefaultfilters that was created earlier in the procedure.

5. The var_Result variable should be declared earlier in the procedure as TEXT to store the result.

6. This code assumes that all the column names (RT, RYID, RYN, etc.) exist in the alltypevalues$appreportdefaultfilters table. If any of these columns are missing, you'll need to adjust the xmlforest function accordingly.

7. The XML generation in PostgreSQL might produce slightly different formatting compared to SQL Server's FOR XML PATH, but the content and structure will be equivalent.

8. If you need to handle NULL values differently or apply any specific formatting to the values, you may need to use CASE statements or other functions within the xmlforest function.

This PostgreSQL code should provide equivalent functionality to the original T-SQL query, generating an XML string with the data from the alltypevalues$appreportdefaultfilters table.

	To convert this T-SQL code to PostgreSQL 16 compatible code, we need to use PostgreSQL's XML functions and string manipulation functions. Here's the equivalent PostgreSQL code:

<sql>
UPDATE dbo.usersetting
SET value = (
    SELECT xmlelement(name "Data",
        xmlagg(
            xmlelement(name "Type",

SET value = replace(replace(value, '&lt;', '<'), '&gt;', '>')
WHERE useraccountid = var_UserAccountID 
  AND userroleid = par_UserRoleID 
  AND settingid = 42;
</sql>

<notes>
1. We use PostgreSQL's XML functions (xmlelement, xmlagg, xmlforest) to generate the XML structure.
2. The generated XML is cast to text using ::text.
3. We perform the update in two steps:
   - First, we generate and set the XML content.
   - Then, we replace the XML entities (&lt; and &gt;) with their corresponding characters (< and >).
4. We use the variables var_UserAccountID and par_UserRoleID which should be defined earlier in the procedure.
5. The settingid is hardcoded to 42 as per the original query.
6. This code assumes that all the column names (RT, RYID, RYN, etc.) exist in the alltypevalues$appreportdefaultfilters table.
7. The WHERE clause ensures that we're updating the correct row in the usersetting table.

This PostgreSQL code should provide equivalent functionality to the original T-SQL query, generating an XML string with the data from the alltypevalues$appreportdefaultfilters table and updating it in the usersetting table.
