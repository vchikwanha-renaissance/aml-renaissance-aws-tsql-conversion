The following is SQL code that you must convert to PostgreSQL compatible code. The code contains comment blocks that contain T-SQL code:
{sct_code}


The following is an action item that identifies which comment block in the code above you must focus on and provide PostgreSQL 16 compatible code:
{action_item}


Your task is to provide PostgreSQL 16 equivalent code for the T-SQL code in each action item that will later be used to replace the T-SQL comment block in the code. 

Your response must adhere to the following rules:
1. Be very deligent and ensure that you thoroughly analyze the code to understand the intent, logic and flow
2. All code that is dynamically executed with an EXECUTE statement must use a FORMAT function
3. The code you provide should be functional
4. Do not return DDL in the <sql> values
5. Only use temporary table names and variable names that have already been mapped to PostgreSQL compatible names already
6. The PostgreSQL you provide must ONLY be a equivalent PostgreSQL translation of the T-SQL code. DO NOT REFACTOR THE CODE!
