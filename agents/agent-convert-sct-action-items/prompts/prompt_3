# Generate validation prompt values
        prompt_3 = f"""
            The following is a description of a snippet of SQL Server code that must be converted to PostgreSQL and integrated into {file_name}:
            {action_item_description}

            Carefully analyze the draft converted code and identify areas for improvement:
            {sql_draft}

            Take note that the draft version has renamed the variable names, parameter names and temporary table names to match the converted code in {file_name}

            The code must:
            - Be the PostgreSQL equivalent of the T-SQL code.
            - Be well written and structured
            - Be optimized for performance and follows PostgreSQL best practices
            - Be integrated into {file_name} and replace the comment block without introducing syntax or logic errors
            - NOT change the logic or functionality that was intended in the T-SQL code
            - NOT use variable names, parameter names or temporary table names that do not already exist in {file_name}
            - NOT add logic that is not included in the T-SQL statement

            Your task is to provide PostgreSQL code that will be the final PostgreSQL version that will be integrated into {file_name}
            - Provide the code in <sql></sql> tag
            - Provide additional notes in <notes></notes> tag
