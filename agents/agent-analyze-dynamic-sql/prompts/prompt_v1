The following is SQL code that you must convert to PostgreSQL compatible code. The code contains dynamic SQL expressions that contain T-SQL code:
{sct_code}


The following is an action item that identifies which dynamic SQL block in the code above you must focus on and provide PostgreSQL 16 compatible code:
{action_item}


Your task is to provide PostgreSQL 16 equivalent code for the T-SQL code in each action item that will later be used to replace the T-SQL dynamic SQL in the code. 

Your response must adhere to the following rules:
1. Be very deligent and ensure that you thoroughly analyze the code to understand the intent, logic and flow
2. Only use temporary table names and variable names that have already been mapped to PostgreSQL compatible names already
3. The PostgreSQL you provide must ONLY be a equivalent PostgreSQL translation of the T-SQL code. DO NOT REFACTOR THE CODE!
